          <h3>About Me<h3>
            <p> Hi! I'm Jordan Levine. I'm a designer/ illustrator living in the Baltimore area. In 2015 I earned an Associates degree in studio art from Montgomery College where I gained experience in painting, color theory, and printmaking. I started designing show flyers and t shirts for local bands in my spare time.
	In the summer of 2015 I worked as a graphic design intern for the 9:30 Club/ I.M.P., where I worked with the art director to create posters, flyers, social media graphics, and signage for their various music venues.
	I then transferred to Towson to pursue a BFA in graphic design.</p>

  <p>I enjoy going to art lectures, concerts, comedy shows, and I take improv classes. I also host a podcast called Coffee & Ink in which I interview designers, illustrators, and other creative people about their craft.
